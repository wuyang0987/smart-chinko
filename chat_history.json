[{"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "I want to an Android app of game coin pusher"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "Okay, I will create a plan for building a React Native + Expo 54 app for a game coin pusher on Android.\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   A visually appealing home screen that simulates a coin pusher machine. This will include the main play area where coins are dropped, the pusher mechanism, and the collection area.\n-   Basic coin dropping functionality. The user should be able to tap or press a button to drop coins into the play area.\n-   A simple scoring system to track the number of coins pushed off the edge.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#B8860B` (Dark Goldenrod)\n    *   Secondary: `#DAA520` (Goldenrod)\n    *   Accent: `#A9A9A9` (Dark Gray)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFD700` (Gold)\n*   **Typography:**\n    *   Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Home Screen Implementation:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` file to create the coin pusher game interface. This will involve:\n    *   Designing the layout with the play area, pusher, and collection zone.\n    *   Adding a button or touch area for coin dropping.\n    *   Implementing the basic coin dropping animation and physics (this might require a library for simple physics).\n    *   Displaying the score.\n2.  **Remove Modal Demos:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is not relevant to the coin pusher game.\n\nOkay, let's start by instructing the coding agent to implement the plan. After the coding agent is done, I will remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-07T12:59:12.139324"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a coin pusher game app!

The physics simulation runs at approximately 60fps for smooth coin movement. You can drop up to 10 coins per game, and the pusher automatically moves to push coins toward the collection zone!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": false, "error_message": "\n> Natively@1.0.0 lint /expo-project\n> eslint .\n\n\n/expo-project/components/CoinPusher.tsx\n  57:6  warning  React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'pusherPosition'.
