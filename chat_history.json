We'll leverage this to simulate coin movement and collisions.\n*   **CoinPusher Component:** The `CoinPusher` component will be the core of the game.

React Native Reanimated might have some limitations here, so we might need to explore other libraries if more advanced collision detection is required.\n*   **Score Calculation:** When coins fall off the edge of the play area (are \"pushed\" off), update the score accordingly.\n*   **Haptic Feedback:** Use Expo Haptics to provide tactile feedback when coins collide or are collected.\n\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-07T13:02:56.839730"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement a coin pusher game with physics!

Here's a vision for how we can approach this, focusing on design and implementation considerations within your React Native and Expo 54 environment:\n\n1.  **3D Coin Rendering:**\n    *   Leverage `expo-graphics` or `three.js` within Expo to render the coins as 3D objects. This will involve creating 3D models for the coins and positioning them in a 3D space.\n    *   Consider using a library like `react-native-gl-model-view` for displaying more complex 3D models if needed.\n\n2.  **Perspective and Camera:**\n    *   Implement a perspective camera to give the scene depth. Allow the user to potentially adjust the camera angle for a better view.\n    *   An animated camera could subtly pan or zoom to enhance the 3D effect.\n\n3.  **Lighting and Shadows:**\n    *   Incorporate lighting to add realism. A directional light or ambient light can make the coins and pusher look more three-dimensional.\n    *   Explore adding shadows to ground the objects in the scene.\n\n4.  **Pusher and Environment:**\n    *   Model the pusher as a 3D object with realistic textures.\n    *   Create a simple 3D environment for the coin pusher, such as a wooden cabinet or arcade setting.\n\n5.  **Physics Engine:**\n    *   While you're currently using React Native Reanimated for basic physics, consider a more robust 3D physics engine like `ammo.js` (through a React Native wrapper) for more realistic coin collisions and movement.\n\n6.  **User Interface:**\n    *   Maintain a clean and intuitive UI. Ensure the \"DROP COIN\" button is easily accessible.\n    *   Display the score and coin count prominently.\n\n7.  **Performance:**\n    *   3D rendering can be performance-intensive. Optimize the 3D models and physics calculations to maintain a smooth frame rate (60 FPS).\n    *   Use React Native's `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-07T13:17:09.693249"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create a 3D coin pusher game!
